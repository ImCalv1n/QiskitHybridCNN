Calvin:
    I added the linear layer and logsoftmax to make the two-class classifier a ten-class classifier. I ran
    accuracy tests on more than one qubit for a one quantum circuit design. I modified the code to run with two
    quantum circuits for both forwards and backwards propogation. I tuned the model and modified the training to
    report training and validation loss. I ran the model and collected the data.
Mukul Dev :
    I have tried to implement the 2 class classfier using qisit library which is Hybrid CNN. I have tried 
    to run the change the qunatum circuits for understanding their impact in accuracy and tried to tweak the number of qubits in
    the code. 
--Running Code--
It is recommended that you use this link to run the code in Google colab:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a_CSHqQfDGmcJg2Ak3lwVai8s1Vm0rs6?usp=sharing
PLEASE NOTE:
This google file is used as the final version of the code that was written, tested, and run in other colab files.
After changes in code were working properly, they were moved into this file and pushed to github. If you are suspicious about the edit history of the code, Calvin can show you files that contain the actual edit history
and modification of the working code.
