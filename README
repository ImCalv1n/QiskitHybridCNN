Calvin:
    I added the linear layer and logsoftmax to make the two-class classifier a ten-class classifier. I ran
    accuracy tests on more than one qubit for a one quantum circuit design. I modified the code to run with two
    quantum circuits for both forwards and backwards propogation. I tuned the model and modified the training to
    report training and validation loss. I ran the model and collected the data.
